# Snake Game
This C++ written snake game is fun to play on Linux platform. 
The game features customizable snake, snake food and map 
character symbols. 
Randomness is the key of our snake game.Your goal is to move the 
snake and eat “food” blocks found at random positions, or picking 
up apples that occur at random intervals. There is only one food 
block at any given time, but there might be multiple apples on 
screen. When the food is eaten, the snake grows in length. But 
when the snake get the apple, it can randomly grow bigger or smaller. 
It will also speed up or down, and it’s only about a matter of 
possibilities. Go 'gambling' with snake!
